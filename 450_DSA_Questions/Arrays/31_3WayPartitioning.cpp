/* Given an array of size N and a range [a, b]. The task is to partition the array around the range such that array is divided into three parts.
1) All elements smaller than a come first.
2) All elements in range a to b come next.
3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to return the modified array.

Example 1:
Input: 
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
[a, b] = [1, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: One possible arrangement is:
{1, 2, 3, 3, 4}. If you return a valid
arrangement, output will be 1. */
