				PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fill The Matrix
A matrix B (consisting of integers) of dimension N × N is said to be good if there exists an array A (consisting of integers) such that B[i][j] = |A[i] - A[j]|, where |x| denotes absolute value of integer x.

You are given a partially filled matrix B of dimension N × N. Q of the entries of this matrix are filled by either 0 or 1. You have to identify whether it is possible to fill the remaining entries of matrix B (the entries can be filled by any integer, not necessarily by 0 or 1) such that the resulting fully filled matrix B is good.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, Q.

Each of the next Q lines contain three space separated integers i, j, val, which means that B[i][j] is filled with value val.
Output
For each test case, output "yes" or "no" (without quotes) in a single line corresponding to the answer of the problem.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ i, j ≤ N
0 ≤ val ≤ 1
Sum of each of N, Q over all test cases doesn't exceed 106

There can be a really easy greedy solution the problem.We can initialise the array A by -1.
There is crucial observation that the array A can be constructed with only two values 0 and 1.
Sort the index value pairs.Now if both the given index are unassigned,assign them according to 
the value given.Like 1 3 1 would mean 1 and 3 would be different .So initialise a[1] with 0 and 
a[3]=a[1]XOR val.Keep doing this and if at some point when both the indices are intialised with 
values!= -1 ,then check if they satisfy the given value,if not break and print -1.


1)I'll initialize an array of size n with -1
2)I'll then iterate over it and start with setting the first A[i] = 0 and then dfs will 
set the rest
3)Now in dfs i'll set the A[j](as already set A[i]) as A[i]^value if A[j]==-1
4)If it's not then it has to be equal to A[i]^value else return false
