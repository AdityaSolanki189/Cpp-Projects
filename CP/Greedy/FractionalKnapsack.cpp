				PROBLEM STATEMENT
You want to paint your house. The total area of your house is D units. There are a total of N
workers. The ith worker is available after time Ti, has hiring cost Xi and speed Yi. This means he becomes 
available for hiring from time Ti and remains available after that. Once available, you can hire
him with cost Xi, after which he will start painting the house immediately, covering exactly Yi 
units of house with paint per time unit. You may or may not hire a worker and can also hire or
fire him at any later point of time. However, no more than 1 worker can be painting the house
at a given time.
Since you want the work to be done as fast as possible, figure out a way to hire the workers, such 
that your house gets painted at the earliest possible time, with minimum cost to spend for hiring workers.
