				PROBLEM STATEMENT
Harshit knows by his resources that this time the winning lottery number is the smallest 
number whose sum of the digits is S and the number of digits is D. You have to help Harshit 
and print the winning lottery number.
Input Format
The Input line contains two space-separated integers: S,D
Output Format
The output contains a single integer denoting the winning lottery number
Constraints
1 <= D <= 1000
1 <= S <= 9*D
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input1:
9 2
Sample Output1:
18
Explanation
There are many other possible numbers like 45, 54, 90, etc with the sum of digits as 9 and 
number of digits as 2. The smallest of them is 18.
