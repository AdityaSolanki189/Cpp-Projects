				PROBLEM STATEMENT
Taj Mahal is one of the seven wonders of the world. Aahad loves to travel places 
and wants to visit Taj Mahal. He visited Agra to view Taj Mahal. There is a ticketing 
system at Taj Mahal. There are total ‘n’ windows which provide the tickets to get entry
into Taj Mahal. There are ‘Ai’ people already present at each window to get the tickets. 
Each window gives ticket to one person in one minute. Initially, Aahad stands in front of
the first window. After each minute, if he didn’t get the ticket, he moves on to the next 
window to get the ticket. If he is at window 1, he will move to 2. If at 2nd, he will move to 3rd.
If he is at last window, he will move to 1st again and so on. 
Find the window number at which he will get the ticket.
