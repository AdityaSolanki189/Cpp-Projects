Given a binary matrix. Find the maximum area of a rectangle formed only of 1s in the given matrix.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 4, m = 4
M[][] = {{0 1 1 0},
         {1 1 1 1},
         {1 1 1 1},
         {1 1 0 0}}
Output: 8
Explanation: For the above test case the
matrix will look like
0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
the max size rectangle is 
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
and area is 4 *2 = 8. */
