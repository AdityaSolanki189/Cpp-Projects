Queues are a type of container adaptors which operate in a first in first out (FIFO) type of arrangement. Elements are inserted at the back (end) and are deleted from the front.

 

The functions supported by queue are :

empty() – Returns whether the queue is empty.
size() – Returns the size of the queue.
queue::swap() in C++ STL: Exchange the contents of two queues but the queues must be of same type, although sizes may differ.
queue::emplace() in C++ STL: Insert a new element into the queue container, the new element is added to the end of the queue.
queue::front() and queue::back() in C++ STL– front() function returns a reference to the first element of the queue. back() function returns a reference to the last element of the queue.
push(g) and pop() – push() function adds the element ‘g’ at the end of the queue. pop() function deletes the first element of the queue.
