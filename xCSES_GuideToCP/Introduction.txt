    #SHORTENING OF THE CODE#

1. The command typedef can be used to give a short name to a data type. For example, the name long long is long, so we can define a short name ll as follows:
    
    typedef long long ll;

    After this, the code
        long long a = 123456789;
        long long b = 987654321;
        cout << a*b << "\n";

    can be shortened as follows:
        ll a = 123456789;
        ll b = 987654321;
        cout << a*b << "\n";

2. Macros Another way to shorten code is to define macros. A macro specifies that certain strings in the code will be changed before the compilation. In C++, macros are defined using the #define keyword.For example, we can define the following macros:

    #define F first
    #define S second
    #define PB push_back
    #define MP make_pair

    After this, the code
        v.push_back(make_pair(y1,x1));
        v.push_back(make_pair(y2,x2));
        int d = v[i].first+v[i].second;

    can be shortened as follows:
        v.PB(MP(y1,x1));
        v.PB(MP(y2,x2));
        int d = v[i].F+v[i].S;

    A macro can also have parameters, which makes it possible to shorten loops and other structures. For example, we can define the following macro:
    
    #define REP(i,a,b) for (int i = a; i <= b; i++)
    
    After this, the code
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        search(i);
        }

    can be shortened as follows:
        REP(i,1,n) {
        search(i);
        }
